To run StellarMC, you need to install Python ([***https://www.python.org/downloads/***](https://www.python.org/downloads/)***)***, and Java 21 ([https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21\_windows-x64\_bin.exe](https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21_windows-x64_bin.exe)), when you have downloaded these, the launcher runs (propably not).



1, Run the python installer and (this is important!) \*disable\* PATH limit of 256 charachters.



2, Extract the "StellarMC-main.zip" to just the C:\\ drive, launcher wants it there, so do it!



3, Open the .py file included with the install kit, wait for the assets and libraries to download and then enjoy!
